# Password-Generator-App

A password generator app creates secure, random passwords for users. It typically allows users to specify criteria such as password length, inclusion of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The app generates a unique password based on these settings and displays it in a user-friendly interface. This helps enhance online security by encouraging the use of strong, unpredictable passwords.
